  title: 'It starts with Great Teaching',
  description: `Chess with Mr. S was founded in 2008 by Arash Shahi.  His idea was to
  hire chess teachers on the basis of their teaching ability first and chess knowledge second.  "It is easier to
  train a good teacher and motivator how to play the game than teach a good chess player the skills of a teacher."
  The Chess with Mr. S faculty are not only expert chess players; they are excellent communicators who know how to
  inspire the students they work with.  Over eight years and hundreds of classes, Arash and the Chess With Mr. S staff have been
  asked back to schools in Toronto time and again by happy students, parents and school faculty.`

  title: 'A Proven Curriculum',
  description: `The Chess With Mr. S curriculum is comprised of over five hundred interactive lessons
  that guide a student from learning the rules of the game to paving the road for true chess mastery.  The entire
  curriculum has been put online to make student exercises and test preparation easier and more fun than ever.
  Unlike some other online platforms this is not a mixed bag of ad-hoc
  articles and puzzles; it is a carefully curated, grandmaster approved curriculum developed and proven
  over the course of eight years in hundreds of classrooms and chess camps.`
